Work so far : 

1) Few industries were identified as directly dependent on crude oil and a few indirectly dependent.
2) The stock price history of each company under each industry has been web scraped from BSE. Crude oil commodity history has also been extracted.
3) Trend has been computed over time on a yearly, half-yearly, quarterly and monthly basis. (refer to : oil_companies_filter.ipynb)
4) Two CSVs holding trend relations of (crude oil,dependent companies) and (crude oil, less dependent companies) over time has been made using the analyseTimeSeries_2() method. [DA_OilTrends - Oil_Companies.csv , DA_OilTrends - Other_Industries.csv]

Note : Many entries are filled with "NOT AVAILABLE" due to missing values or because the company went public recently. The companies existing since 2012 have been considered for analysis.

5) In "analyse_sectors.ipynb" we have three ways of trend correlations. Methods defined in "analyse_sectors.ipynb" have been used in "analyse_independent_sectors.ipynb" as well. "max_logic.ipynb" and "max_logic_weak.ipynb" cover the correlation by considering the most frequent trend across the industry


Results - 

The third correlation approach yeilded results.


Files : 

oil_companies_filter.ipynb - Two methods are defined to find trend of a time series.

analyse_sectors.ipynb - Has first two methods for correlating trends for strong companies.
analyse_independent_sectors.ipynb - Has first two methods for correlating trends for weak companies.
max_logic.ipynb - Has the third method of correlation for strong companies.
max_logic_weak.ipynb - Has the third method of correlation for weak companies.

Note : The markdown sections of these ipynb files have explanations.
