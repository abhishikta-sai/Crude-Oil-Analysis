Work so far : 

1) Few industries were identified as directly dependent on crude oil and a few indirectly dependent.
2) The stock price history of each company under each industry has been web scraped from BSE. Crude oil commodity history has also been extracted.
3) Trend has been computed over time on a yearly, half-yearly, quarterly and monthly basis. (refer to : oil_companies_filter.ipynb)
4) Two CSVs holding trend relations of (crude oil,dependent companies) and (crude oil, less dependent companies) over time has been made using the analyseTimeSeries_2() method. [DA_OilTrends - Oil_Companies.csv , DA_OilTrends - Other_Industries.csv]

Note : Many entries are filed with "NOT AVAILABLE" due to missing values or because the company went public recently. The companies existing since 2012 have been considered for analysis.

5) In "analyse_sectors.ipynb" we have two ways of trend correlations. Methods defined in "analyse_sectors.ipynb" have been used in "analyse_independent_sectors.ipynb" as well.


Results - 

No significant trend correlation. We have to look at other ways to find if there is any correlation between (crude oil, industry)

Further Work - 

We could come up with models that help predict the trend of a company, given the crude oil trend history and sector.
Models - 
1) Neural network model
2) Decision Tree model (Saw some paper)

These are recommendations only. We have to work till we get some results.
